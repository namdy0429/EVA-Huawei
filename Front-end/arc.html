ARC uses the words in the source code of a system to detect the concerns the system addresses. It then uses those concerns to group code entities into clusters that represent components. </br></br>

Architecture Recovery using Concerns (ARC) recovers concerns of implementation-level entities and uses a hierarchical clustering technique to obtain architectural elements. ARC recovers concerns using the statistical language model LDA, which is obtained from the identifiers and comments in a system’s source code. LDA allows ARC to compute similarity measures between concerns and identify which concerns appear in a single implementation-level entity. Thus, ARC attempts to rely on a program’s semantics to perform recovery. ARC represents a software system as a set of documents. A document can have different topics, which are the concerns in ARC. A topic z is a multinomial probability distribution over words w. A document d is represented as a multinomial probability distribution over topics z (called the document-topic distribution). Each implementation-level entity is treated as a document where its document-topic distribution is its feature vector. Hierarchical clustering is performed by computing similarities between entities using the Jensen-Shannon divergence (Djs), which allows computing similarities between document-topic distributions.
